# BERGAN


trying to make techno with GANs, default is to train on 2sec audio clips at 16kHz = 1 bar 4/4 at 120BPM

generator and multi-scale discriminators derived from the MelGAN architecture

default working config = WGANGP_2scales_WN_WN_crop0.gin

without GP, it sucks, also avoid BN discriminator with GP


## TODO

try training at 32kHz

train as a VAE/GAN or WAE/GAN to avoid mode collapse of GAN and use deep feature reconstruction in discriminator activations


## GAN TRAINING


## VAE/GAN or WAE/GAN TRAINING

to come


## GENERATION
